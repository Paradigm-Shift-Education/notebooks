    "If you’ve ever been on a roller coaster, you know the mounting feeling of suspense as you’re strapped into your seat and the ride starts to inch higher and higher, followed by the most exhilarating drop of your life, as you embark on a thrill ride of your life, filled with barrel rolls into two corkscrews in quick succession followed by a drop that makes your stomach feel likes it’s jumping out of your mouth, but finally the ride screeches to a halt as you approach the platform. You have a choice: do you keep going or stop.\n",

    "Computer scientists created the concept of a loop to represent doing something until some condition is met. In terms of our roller coaster example, the condition could be whether  you’re having fun, and the body of the loop that you do would be going on the ride. Each time you do whatever is inside the loop, such as going on the ride, is called one iteration of the loop. This concept is called a while loop, and this is what the syntax looks like:\n",

This variable will be our condition. Initially having_fun is equal to true, since you love roller coasters! If you want to ride the roller coaster until you’re no longer having fun, the resulting loop would look like this:"

Well, like actual roller coasters, we can’t just stop halfway through the loop, once we get on, we have to go through the entire ride. This is because the condition for the loop is only checked before each iteration of the loop. Now you might think to yourself, that’s not a very good system, what if an emergency comes up and I need to get off right away?? That’s exactly  why computer scientists came up with the concept of break, which breaks you out of whatever loop you’re currently in.\n",
