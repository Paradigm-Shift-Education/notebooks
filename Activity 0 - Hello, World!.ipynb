While these are a part of computer science, all of your hours sculpting a masterful algorithm are no good if it can’t interact with the world! There forms of IO (input/output) through which we can interact with our programs, in this series of activities, we will be simplfying things, and giving you a *Jupyter Notebook*, which is what you are in right now."

While Python 3 (specifically 3.5.2 at the time of writing) is the newest version of the Python programming language, Python 2 is still commonly used. While the two are very similar, they are not strictly interoperable, and so you may encounter code that does not run in Python 3 because it was written for Python 2. Don't worry about this too much, but be aware of it."

    "We’ve now seen two ways to add a name (or any other phrase) to a print statement. Basically, in the first example, we can add or “concatenate” two “strings” (like `\"Hello, \"`, `\"Emily\"` or `\"!\"`), this works similarly to adding numbers (e.g. `\"Hello, \" + \"Emily\"` gives us `\"Hello, Emily\"` and `\"Hello, Emily\" + \"!\"` (equivalent to `\"Hello, \" + \"Emily\" + \"!\"`) gives us `\"Hello, Emily!\"`, a single string that we can print just like `\"Hello, World!\"`.\n",

    "In the second example, we use a feature of Python called “string formatting”, that allows us to insert strings into a template without manually writing out all of the string addition (there is more to string formatting than this, but you don’t need to worry about that for now). In our example `\"Hello, {name}!\".format(name=\"Jacob\")` inserts `\"Jacob\"` in the place of `\"{name}\"` in the template `\"Hello, {name}!\"`, giving us the final string `\"Hello, Jacob!\"`, which we print out to the terminal. We could do the same with other templates (e.g. `\"Hi, I’m from {place}\".format(place=\"California\")`)."
