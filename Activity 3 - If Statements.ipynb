    "We’re now going to introduce one of the most powerful tools in all of Computer Science: `If Statements`! \n",
    "\n",
    "What these allow us to do is check **if** a certain condition is **True**. You probably already make a bunch of if statements in your everyday life without even realizing it! For example, **if** it is raining outside, you will bring an umbrella with you to school. **If** you have a test tomorrow, you probably should be studying instead of watching a movie. \n",
    "\n",
    "In both these cases, we have a `condition`, and a *response* if that `condition == True`. `If statements` in Python follow a very standard format, and you’ll probably be using them all the time. A standard case looks like this:"

    "If you’re thinking `x` has to be greater than 0, you’d be correct. Therefore, we can say that if `x` is greater than 0, `x` must be positive. \n",

Let’s say that if your residential area has a population of over 100,000, it’s a city. If it’s less than that, we’ll call it a town. We’ll write a program that prints either town or city based on population, which we can express as `p`. Try to find what we're changing and how that changes the result that gets printed."
